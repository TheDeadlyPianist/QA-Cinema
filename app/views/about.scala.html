                <h1 style="text-align: center">The History Of QA</h1>
                <p>Founded back in 1930, QA is the largest and best-known cinema chain in the UK and Ireland. And, famous the world over, QA Leicester Square has hosted over 700 of Europe’s biggest film premieres since the 1930s. </p>

                <p>Perry Bar in Birmingham saw the first QA cinema open in 1930, and established the brand as not only somewhere to watch films, but somewhere to experience them too. Iconic art deco architecture and the very latest technology became synonymous with QA where you didn’t just go to see a film, you went to the cinema.

            <h1 style="text-align: center">Screen Information</h1>

                <p>We have always been at the forefront of cinematic experience: both IMAX and ISENSE offer extraordinary cinema viewing, and we also operate Manchesters' BFI IMAX which is the largest cinema screen in the UK.</p>

                <p>We have the UK’s biggest cinema loyalty scheme - QA Première Club - with over 2 million members. And in 2016 we launched our popular Limitless card – offering guests the chance to see all the films they want, as often as they like.</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center">Concession Stands</h1>

                <p>We also offer so much more than popcorn and soft drinks. We now have Costa Coffee in many of our cinemas, a superb cocktail lounge called Ambar at some sites, or our Gallery offering includes unlimited popcorn, nachos and soft drinks in other locations. And The Lounge is the ultimate in luxury cinema-going.</p>

                <p>We pride ourselves in the very best cinema experience: cutting-edge technology and the widest choice of experiences (this extends way beyond the box office – we also screen live sports and cultural events and special screenings for specific groups too).</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center">Accessibility Information</h1>

                <p>Our cinema has full disabled access, so you can enjoy all our great facilities — from scrumptious snacks at our retail stands to soothing hot drinks at Costa. All tills and service points have hearing induction loops. As you move through the cinema you can find our fully accessible toilets on the ground and first floor.</p>

                <p>Our screens are all also fully accessible, with wheelchair spaces in each and infra red enabling Audio Description (film specific) or extra amplification via headset. As most are fitted with stadium-style seating, the wheelchair spaces tend to be near the front of the screen. Each of our Gallery screens has wheelchair space, near the back. All wheelchair spaces are accompanied by a companion seat.</p>

                <p>CEA Card: As part of a general cinema industry initiative, all our cinemas accept the CEA Card which entitles the holder to one free ticket for their carer. For further information please visit www.ceacard.co.uk (opens in a new window).</p>
